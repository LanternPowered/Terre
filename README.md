Terre is a Terraria proxy which aims to bring support for multi world and cross platform play between mobile and desktop
 clients. It is possible to customize the proxy to your liking by installing plugins or even develop your own.

**The proxy is still is a work in progress, bugs are to be expected. There are currently no official builds, so for now 
you will need to build the project yourself.**
 
The following list gives an overview of each sub-project in this repository.

* **proxy** - The actual proxy server.
* **test** - A test environment which can be used in the IDE, which will include plugins from the repository.
* **portals** - A plugin which allows you to create portals to teleport between servers (worlds).
* **tshock-users** - A plugin which hooks into the tShock user and permission system, so they can work together.
