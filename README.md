# Terre [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-on%20discord-6E85CF.svg)](https://discord.gg/ArSrsuU)

Terre is a Terraria proxy which aims to bring support for multi world and cross-platform play 
between mobile and desktop clients. It is possible to customize the proxy to your liking by 
installing plugins or even develop your own.

**The proxy is still is a work in progress, bugs are to be expected. There are currently no official 
builds, so for now you will need to build the project yourself.**
 
The following list gives an overview of each sub-project in this repository.

* **proxy** - The actual proxy server.
* **image** - A docker image build containing the proxy and all the official plugins.
* **standalone** - Packs terre and all its dependencies into a single jar.
* **test** - A test environment which can be used in the IDE, which will include plugins from the 
repository.
* **portals** - A plugin which allows you to create portals to teleport between servers (worlds).
* **tshock-users** - A plugin which hooks into the tShock user and permission system, so they can 
work together. (Placeholder)
* **k8s-server-finder** A plugin that discovers Terraria servers on a kubernetes cluster and 
  automatically registers them.

## Prerequisites
* [Java 17] or newer, JDK 17 for development
* [Docker Desktop] when building and testing the docker images locally

## Clone
The following steps will ensure the project is cloned properly.
1. `git clone https://github.com/LanternPowered/Terre.git`
2. `cd Terre`

## Building
__Note:__ If you do not have [Gradle] installed then use `./gradlew` for Unix systems or Git Bash and 
`gradlew.bat` for Windows systems in place of any `gradle` command.

In order to build Terre you can use the following `gradle` commands.

### Standalone
Build the standalone jar, which can be found in `./standalone/build/libs` after running the 
following command. The jar is labeled similarly to `terre-standalone-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
```
gradle build
```
This also builds portals and the other plugins, the jar of these plugins can for example be 
found in `./portals/build/libs` and are labeled similarly to `terre-portals-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.jar`. 
These plugin jars can be put into the plugins directory of Terre to enable extra functionality.

### Docker image
Build the docker image and publish it to the local docker daemon with the 
`cybermaxke/terre:latest` tag. The docker images contains all the official plugins by default, 
which can be disabled through the config.
```
gradle jibDockerBuild
```
